# FindBigFoot
This replit was built to showcase CSS and JavaScript skills. It is a simple game where you look for Big Foot and when you see him, click him. He then moves and you can try to find him again as many times as you like. Made with the assistance of Vincent Shuali (vincentshuali.repl.co). 

I followed the instructions from https://workshops.hackclub.com/find_bigfoot/ but I also made a better picture of Big Foot that did not have any background as part of the picture. I also researched how to make the image fade out, move, and then fade in. 

I completed most of the work, but did need assistance on finetuning the CSS and JavaScript, which I received from Vincent Shuali (vincentshuali.repl.co). He is a fellow developer working to showcase his skills and break into the technology world.
